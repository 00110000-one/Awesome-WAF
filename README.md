__A Concise Definition:__ A web application firewall is a form of firewall with a set of configured rules that controls input, output, and/or access from, to, or by an application or service. It operates by monitoring and potentially blocking the input, output, or system service calls that do not meet the configured policy of the firewall. *(Source [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_firewall))*
